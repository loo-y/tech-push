# Project Handover Document: Tech Push - Cloudflare Workers

**Date:** 2025年1月30日星期四
**Project Name:** Tech Push
**Current Directory:** `/Users/luyi/Code/GithubCode/tech-push`

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a multi-component application designed to leverage Cloudflare Workers for serverless functions, a React application for the frontend, and a Python component for potential backend services. The goal is to provide a scalable and performant solution by utilizing Cloudflare's edge network capabilities.

**Key Features:**
- 🎵 **Audio File Management**: Complete audio upload, storage, and management system
- 📱 **Multi-page React Application**: Independent page routing with separate components
- ☁️ **Cloudflare R2 Storage**: Scalable object storage for audio files
- 🤖 **Hugging Face Integration**: AI/ML capabilities for content processing
- 🚀 **Serverless Architecture**: Edge computing with Cloudflare Workers

## 2. Current Status

The project is currently set up with the following main components:

### Core Components:

*   **Cloudflare Worker (`src/worker/`):** 
    - Main serverless backend using Hono framework
    - Audio upload service with R2 storage integration
    - Hugging Face API integration for AI/ML tasks

    - RESTful API endpoints for file management

*   **React Frontend (`src/react-app/`):** 
    - Multi-page React application built with Vite
    - Independent page routing system
    - Audio upload interface with drag-and-drop support
    - Modern UI with responsive design
    - Component-based architecture

*   **Python Backend (`src/python/app.py`):** 
    - Placeholder for additional backend services
    - Could be used for complex data processing or AI model serving
